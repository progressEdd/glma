## Overall Progress
- Tree Sitter potential uses
- Testing llms for summarizing code blocks

## Tree Sitter Potential Uses
- Tree Sitter works, but single line comments don't get merged into bigger blocks or the proceeding code blocks
  - Additional exploration needs to figure out the logic
  - Alternatively, we can just move forward and just start having a llm write summaries
- We would also need a dynamic way of being able to automatically set the file type for tree sitter

## Testing LLMs for Summarizing Code Blocks
- Tried structured outputs with gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0
- Tested on [bootp.c](../00-supporting-files/data/linux-kernel/arch/alpha/boot/bootp.c)
  - specifcally this snippet:
    ```c
    extern unsigned long switch_to_osf_pal(unsigned long nr,
      struct pcb_struct *pcb_va, struct pcb_struct *pcb_pa,
      unsigned long *vptb);
    ```
